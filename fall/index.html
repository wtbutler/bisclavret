The cool air, once again dry, lifted his spirits once again. This was the season of dying. The dying
of the trees, of plants. The beginning of the winter slumber for many prey. The last chance for any
variety in his meals. It was soon coming up on a year of him living like this. He wasn't sure of the
day. Individual days were hard to track, and there was no point anyway. It marked the dying of his
hope, as well. His hope of returning to humanity. Perhaps he should move on from here. Leave this
behind and try to start fresh. He could hear howling in the distance, the howling of a hunter. Of
a hound.
