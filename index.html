                <p>
The sky lightened as birds sang on the morning that the lord padded towards the old chapel. Tired
after a long night of hunting, he almost didn't notice the scent of his wife lingering on the path.
Had she come to see his hiding spot? He'd only recently told her about it. Perhaps she had just been
curious. He reached the bush that held his clothes and pushed his face down under it only to see
that there was nothing there. <I>No.</I> How could this have happened? He should have known not to
tell her, to tell anyone. Mind racing, he started looking around other bushes, just to make sure he
hadn't misplaced them. Nothing. He looked back under the first bush just to make sure, absolutely
sure, that it was empty. It was. The first light of the new day started to touch the tops of the
trees. Despair filled him, and he wondered where he should even go. Whether he should distance
himself from this place, or hope that he might be able to somehow find his clothes again.
