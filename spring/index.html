The storm crashed around him, wind blowing across the mouth of the cave and rain pelting the mouth
almost rhythmically. He hated the rain. It always made him colder than snow did. It bled into his
fur, the cold sinking into his bones. He barely remembered what it was like to be in a house during
a storm. To be warm, dry, protected. To sit by the fireplace as the crackling hearth drowned out
the distant thunder. Maybe he remembered more than he thought he had. He wished he didn't. It would
make not having it so much easier. He waited, a sodden tangle of fur, until the storm blew itself
out and died down to a faint wind. The clouds scattered, and the moon came out, its squashed shape
still bright enough to light the night.
