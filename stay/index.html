The howls grew closer, separating into individual barks and bays. The sound of hounds was a
frightening thing when one was the prey, but he wasn't worried. There were plenty of other things
that would be better to hunt. The sounds drew even nearer. Perhaps it was best to start moving
away, just in case. He started to trot away, at a pace that he could maintain for miles. The howls
followed him. Uncertainly bubbled in him, but determination shoved it down, as he broke into a
faster paced run. This couldn't be happening. He couldn't be prey, it wasn't supposed to work like
this. When the howls didn't fade into the distance, he turned towards the nearest river, running
at a dead sprint. He had to lose them, somehow. He splashed into the river and waded in the banks
upstream for a half a mile, all the while the howls followed him. He finally tracked back across
onto the same side, hoping they'd assume he'd swum across.
