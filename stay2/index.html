Ahead of him, a pair of dogs crested a hill. There had been another pair, and it looked like they
had just gotten a lucky guess at where he was going. He turned, nearly falling over in the process,
but they caught sight of him and howled. The other dogs howled in reply, and he knew he wouldn't
lose them again. All he could do was hope to wear them out. He ran. He didn't look behind him,
he knew that he wasn't going to lose them any time soon, and he couldn't afford to slow down even
that much. He ran for the deepest part of the woods, hoping that maybe, <i>maybe</i> it would slow
them down or frustrate them.
