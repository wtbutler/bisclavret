He hadn't stopped running, not even when the dogs started chasing him. They weren't letting him
walk, and he knew they wouldn't release him once he got to whoever was hunting him. He heard them
before he saw them. Their cheers rose above the woods. He passed under trees and bushes and was
finally able to make out a large gathering of people, all on a hunt. Among them was a figure wearing
a deep blue. Was that... could the <i>King</i> be out? He wasn't sure what to think about that,
though at least it meant seeing a familiar face. The knights had heard the hounds and set up boar
spears to keep him from charging, and his pursuers sped up. He had nothing more to give though, and
soon they were nipping at his heels. An old urge kicked in that seemed ridiculous to him, even in
his exhaustion. If he could just get to the King... He could no longer sprint, but even a wolf's
trot is faster than a man would expect. He moved around the wall of spears, unable to avoid a dog
biting down on his hind leg. His gait slowed even further, he barely made it to the King without
the hounds downing him. The King's horse shied away from him, and the King, though slow to react,
looked terrified. Before the horse was able to turn, however, he reached up and pressed his closed
muzzle against the King's foot and held it there for a half a second. Then he pulled back and did
the same to his leg. He couldn't see the King's face, but he heard a shocked noise, as the hounds
finally got a solid hold on him.
