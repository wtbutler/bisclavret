These were his favorite days of the year, when the nights were warm and the prey was plentiful and
fat. He had all he could ever want, practically whenever he wanted. He knew he wasn't alone in
these woods. He had seen other wolves, several families traveling together. They avoided him. Not
in the same way that one group avoided another, but in the way that a wolf avoids a bear. He was
respected as a predator, yes, but he wasn't one of them. They knew that something was off about him.
That he didn't truly belong. Was there any place that he belonged any more? He had nearly given up
the idea of ever finding his clothes again.
