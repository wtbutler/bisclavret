The snow drifted quietly around him, blown by a soft and silent wind. It was hard to find food in
the winter, certainly harder than it had been in the summer, but it was far from impossible. He was
no rabbit, stocking up on food throughout the year and resting the winter away. He was a hunter.
He was meant to kill. His nose was cold and dry, but his fur kept the rest of him quite warm. His
nostrils flared as he caught scent of a deer, no, two deer. The trail wasn't old, they'd passed by
only maybe earlier this evening. It would only take a few hours to track them down. He traveled at
a trot for a mile, two miles, four. The scent became fresher and fresher, until he was close enough
that he slowed down for fear of alerting them. He crouched low to the ground, stalking around trees,
staying out of line-of-sight, until he was close enough to pounce.
