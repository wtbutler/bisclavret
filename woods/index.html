The forest made far more sense. It was safer there, and he knew it well enough. On his first sunrise
in the woods, truly in the woods now, no longer a visitor, he simply found a boulder and took a nap.
There was a lot that he could be doing, but first and foremost he needed to sleep after his long
night. He didn't sleep deeply. Through the day, his dreams, interwoven with brief moments of
wakefulness, lingered on his predicament. On who trapped him here. His blood would have boiled if
he was fully awake, but instead he just stewed in his anger. Visions of blood filled his dreams.
He woke with the sun hanging low in the sky. His stomach growled, and he knew that he would have to
eat soon.
